The IDOI MVC is deployed on Azure. The codebase requires Entity Framework 6.4, Boostrap 4.6.0, and Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework 2.2.3.

STARTING THE APP

USING THE APP
------------
The database contains tables for Complaints, Agents, Insurers, Admin Actions, Investigators, and Consumers. The homepage displays current complaints and the Invesigator detail shows complaints assigned.

Future implementations will include impact analysis pages, duplicate value handling, and more customized views.
